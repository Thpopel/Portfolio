# Hello and Welcome!
My name is Thomas, and I'm a Bachelor of Science student completing a major in Neuroscience with a minor in Computer Science at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. This portfolio is an opportunity for me to showcase some of the coding skills I have been developing over the past semester. Enjoy! 

As an additional note before you view my portfolio, any words that are `highlighted` may be jargon, please view an explanation of the term at the bottom of any topic. 

**Together, we will take a look at the following topics:**
- Slicing 1D and 2D Lists/Arrays
- For Loops and Nested Loops
- Descriptive Statistics and Manipulation of Dataframes
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- EEG Data Visualization 

### Errors in Coding
To begin this portfolio I'd like to start by illustrating the types of errors that may occur when coding - I have placed this demonstration first as it's foundational to how I avoided them in the remainder of my code. Please click [here](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/a517a3bc-c3e1-4cb2-96b4-e2fc3ff9797d) to take a look at my verbal demonstration on error checking.

### Slicing 1D and 2D Lists/Arrays:
Secondly, I'd like to continue by showing a demonstration on slicing values from a 1D or 2D list, and/or arrays. Please click [here](Slicingvalues.md) to view this topic in greater detail. 

### For loops and Nested Loops:
Once I had a handle on slicing values from a list/array, and how to view specific items, it became important to be able to read multiple values in at once and compare them. For loops provide an excellent method of itterating through each item of a list. Please click [here](loops.md) to learn more about loops.  

### Descriptive Statistics and Manipulation of Dataframes:
**Descriptive statistic** are another vital component of data analysis. By utilizing different tools provided by different modules, we can maximize efficiency and accuracy.

### Exploratory Data Analysis:
Communicating your results visually is also another vital component of presenting them effectively. Please take a look at my topic on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** [here](dataviz.md) Carrying on with our video game data calculations, lets visualize the results.

### Biomedical Image Analysis
Lastly, to conclude this portfolio I'd like to highlight some of the Biomedical Image Analysis that can be done. Please click [here](eeg.md) to view this topic.
