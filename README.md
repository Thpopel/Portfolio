## Hello and Welcome!
This portfolio it an opportunity for me to showcase some of the intro-level coding skills I have been working on over the past couple of months. 

#### Together, we will take a look at the following:
- Slicing 1D and 2D Lists/Arrays
- Descriptive Statistics
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Combining it all Together

#### Slicing 1D and 2D Lists/Arrays:
To begin this portfolio I'd like to start by showing a demonstrationg on slicing. Comprehending how to slice values of a list or array correctly is something I learnt early on as being imperative to prevent logical errors. Afterwards I will go into further simple examples of 1D and 2D slicing of lists, and provide a more realistic example. 

**Please view my verbal demonstration on 1D array slicing:** [Demonstration Video](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/74a2f817-cb5b-4a93-a108-637a08793719)
