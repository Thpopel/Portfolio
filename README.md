# Hello and Welcome!
This portfolio it an opportunity for me to showcase some of the intro-level coding skills I have been working on over the past couple of months. 

**Together, we will take a look at the following:**
- Slicing 1D and 2D Lists/Arrays
- Descriptive Statistics
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Combining it all Together

## Slicing 1D and 2D Lists/Arrays:
To begin this portfolio I'd like to start by showing a demonstration on slicing values. Comprehending how to slice values from a list or an array correctly is something I learnt early on as being imperative to prevent `logical errors`. Afterwards, I will go into further simple examples of 1D and 2D slicing of lists, and provide a more realistic example. 

**Please view my verbal demonstration on 1D array slicing:** [Demonstration Video](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/74a2f817-cb5b-4a93-a108-637a08793719)

After viewing my demonstration, I'd like to highlight a couple key takeaways. These include:
- Slicing from a 1D list/array takes the following form: **[X, Y]**
- **X** is the first index value where we would like to begin slicing from, and it's corresponding value in the list or array is **included**. 
- **Y** is the second index value we would like to end our slice at, and its corresponding value in the list or array is **not included**. 
- **Index values** start at **zero**. 

With this in mind, here are some further examples: 

**1D Array:**[Example of 1D Array](1D array.md)

**2D Array:**[Example of 2D Array](2D array.md)

**Practical Example:**

**Jargon Listed in this Portfolio:**
- **Logical errors:** Logical errors are errors that do not cause the program to terminate abnormally, but instead are mistakes in a program's code that cause it to produce an unexpected or incorrect response or calculation.
